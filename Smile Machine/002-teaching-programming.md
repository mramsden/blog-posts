# Teaching Programming

In a step to give something back I’ve started volunteering with the [Wizzie Wizzie Computer Coding Club](http://wizziewizzie.org). 

It’s a small group started in a room in a North London library. The sessions are built on the basis of getting the child to think up a game to make and then go ahead and create it. Mentors are on hand to help them make their ideas into working code.

There are lots of tools out there to simplify and help support teaching program, and there are two that the group is currently using;

* [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) -
An application developed at MIT. It has been around for a while and gone through various updates. In it’s latest update it is a web-based application. I think that it’s a great tool as it starts to introduce children to programming without getting them bogged down in the trivia of coding and syntax.
* [Greenfoot](http://greenfoot.org) -
Aimed at a slightly older age group than Scratch. Greenfoot is based on Java and is intact developed by the same group who developed BlueJ, (the first IDE I used when learning Java at university on my programming 101 course). Slightly more prior preparation is required with this tool as the children need to become comfortable with Java syntax.

Both applications are designed to allow the child to explore programming computers without having piles and piles of theory taught to them before they even place their hands on the mouse and keyboard. I believe that this is really critical in teaching a new topic, you have to illustrate that something of value can be created very quickly on a computer, the real meaty details of how you get there can always be filled in later.

I think it’s important that we expose more of the world to coding. The recent developments in the UK education system and the newfound interest in teaching programming at schools is a move in the right direction. Emily wrote a great post about [the future of education](http://www.smilemachine.com/the-future-of-education) in which she talked to digital education providers, and I think this illustrates how technology can continue to be a force for good in education. But at the same token this is still only teaching our children to be consumers of that technology. 

There is a current ground-swell for teaching computing to more and more people. It's been hard to miss efforts such as [code.org](http://code.org/) in the US have been championing the call for spending an hour to get started with coding. They've even managed to get presidential support;

I would love to see programming being taught as another avenue of content creation. Just as we are already taught Art, from the outset we are given paints and a blank canvas to start with. Admittedly our first work might be hand prints, but it’s a unique piece of expression. Only later down the line do we start to learn about the history of Art and it’s numerous forms and how that impacts on what is done today. Tools such as Scratch and Greenfoot offer a “canvas first” approach to programming which can be immediately engaging.

It's still early days with the group and we've had a promising first few weeks with a good number of children coming along, and fortunately enough developers to mentor them. I'll be sure to report back in a few months to fill you in on how we're getting on!
