# Teaching Programming

In a step to give something back I’ve started volunteering with the [Wizzie Wizzie Computer Coding Club](http://wizziewizzie.org). It’s a small group started in a room in a North London library. How did I end up in this position? I went along to a Android developer’s meet up and got speaking to one of the people responsible for this group.

There are lots of tools out there to simplify and help support teaching program, and there are two that the group is currently using;

## [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/)

An application developed at MIT. It has been around for a while and gone through various updates. In it’s latest update it is a web-based application. I think that it’s a great tool as it starts to introduce children to programming without getting them bogged down in the trivia of coding and syntax. Instead they can make things that move on screen with a simple drag and drop interface. It is very similar to developing with tools such as Lego Mindstorms.

## [Greenfoot](http://greenfoot.org)

Aimed at a slightly older age group than Scratch. Greenfoot is based on Java and is intact developed by the same group who developed BlueJ, (the first IDE I used when learning Java at university on my Programming 101 course). There’s a bit more to explain as the child needs to start to learn the syntax of Java and the code that needs to be written but the Greenfoot team have done a great job of creating a simple API for creating similar games as you can create in Scratch.

Both applications are designed to allow the child to explore programming computers without having piles and piles of theory taught to them before they even place their hands on the mouse and keyboard. I believe that this is really critical in teaching a new topic, you have to illustrate that something of value can be created very quickly on a computer, the real meaty details of how you get there can always be filled in later.

In an interesting development we’ve actually had interest from the children’s parents to get a bit of exposure to programming as well. At the moment the group is primarily focused on showing the kids what they can do with computers, but it would be great to start introducing their parents to coding as well.

I think it’s important that we expose more of the world to coding. The recent developments in the UK education system and the newfound interest in teaching programming at schools is a move in the right direction. Emily wrote a great post about [the future of education](http://www.smilemachine.com/the-future-of-education) in which she talked to digital education providers, and I think this illustrates how technology can continue to be a force for good in education. But at the same token this is still only teaching our children to be consumers of that technology.

I want to see programming being taught as another avenue of content creation. Just as we are already taught Art, from the outset we are given paints and a blank canvas to start with. Admittedly our first work might be hand prints, but it’s a unique piece of expression. Only later down the line do we start to learn about the history of Art and it’s numerous forms and how that impacts on what is done today. Tools such as Scratch and Greenfoot offer a “canvas first” approach to programming which can be immediately engaging.
